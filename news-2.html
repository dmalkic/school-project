    <h4>Manchester United is pleased to confirm Amad Diallo's arrival from Atalanta has been finalised.</h4>
        <p class="description">The Ivorian winger has signed a contract to the end of June 2025, with the option of an extra year</p>
    <div class="a">
        <p>When an agreement between the clubs was first announced on 5 October 2020 - deadline day at the end of the summer transfer window - it was subject to a medical, work-permit and personal terms.
            These steps in the process have been completed, and an application has been made for a visa. Once this has been issued, Diallo will be cleared to travel to Manchester and to train with and play for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side.</p></div>

<div class="a">
        <p>Diallo featured twice for Atalanta's first team earlier this season, both as a substitute in home games. He played the last 10 minutes against Hellas Verona in Serie A on 28 November, and then faced FC Midtyjlland a few days later in the Champions League, coming on in the 68th minute.

            The 18-year-old, who played regularly in Atalanta's youth ranks, made a total of five senior appearances for the Italian club and scored one goal, on his debut against Udinese in October 2019.</p></div>

       <div class="a">
            <p> Amad Diallo commented: “After waiting since the summer, it is finally a dream come true to complete my move to Manchester United. I am hugely ambitious and there is so much that I want to achieve in the game; when I spoke to the manager I knew that I had joined the perfect club.

            “This is a really exciting squad with so many great players, I can promise that I will work hard every day to learn from them and give everything to develop my game. The coaches have been fantastic since I signed, we have been in touch regularly and they have already given me a lot of great advice.

            “I have had time to prepare for this move, both physically and mentally, and I have worked really hard to be ready to make the step up to this amazing club.”

            Diallo's United shirt number will be announced in the coming days.</p></div>
